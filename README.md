# odin-recipes

This is my first repo. It's a simple HTML project about recipes.
I will also practice Git commits using conventional commits. 
It's part of the curriculum from The Odin Project.

## What I've Learned

* *Git*: I learned how to add files to the staging area, 
commit using conventional commit messages, and push my 
local repository to a remote one.

* *Media Licensing*: I learned about different types of licenses 
— which media I can use freely and which I cannot, based on 
their license type.

* *Attribution*: I learned how to properly attribute media 
that requires attribution, based on the license terms 
and requirements.

* *CSS*: I learned how to use css to style a basic webpage, how to use div as a container, how to center a div, and how to reset browser default properties.
